East China Normal University Colorado State University University of Wisconsin-Madison I like meeting new people and learning from them because new things help me know the world better and have a optimistic attitude towards life. When I lead my small group meetings during my work as a Transfer Transition Leader, I learned a lot from other students' different backgrounds, experiences, which dress and behave myself. By talking to those students, it is true that everybody's life has its hard part, the only thing we could do is to be motivated and optimistic about the future. Admittedly, I have to respect diverse people no matter what their backgrounds are.

The Community College of Baltimore County Towson Catholic High School Just celebrated my two year anniversary with Hope Furrer Associates and am continuing to be challenged by the Back River Wastewater Treatment Plant Enhanced Nutrient Removal Process project. The plant, which can treat up to 180 million gallons per day, is being upgraded to meet more stringent requirements under the Chesapeake Bay Restoration program. Major components of the $263 million project include construction of 52 biological denitrification filters, a 300 million gallon per day pumping station, chemical feed facilities, other supporting facilities such as electrical buildings, as well as renovations to the existing activated sludge treatment reactors and chemical facility, and other infrastructure such as roads, utilities and process control systems. The project is about 2/3 complete; in my role as Construction Administrator, I have processed 900 RFIs, 1,800 submittals, and nearly 200 change requests. In this role I am working with the engineering/design team, the City of Baltimore, the Construction Manager and the Contractor. It is my first time working directly for an engineer, thus rounding out my 30 years of experience which already includes project accounting and project management for general contractors and Owners. The ENR project is expected to be complete in 2017, and when finished the denitrification filters will be the largest facility in the world of its kind.

Woodbury High School University of Wisconsin-Stout I graduated from Woodbury High School in the spring of 2015.

I hope to secure a job working part time for a team or brokerage to pay my way through school but if not I will take on more tasks under my father's own properties to gain more hands on experience. Once I graduate I hope to work a government based job, gain experience within the political realm and help with projects amongst the community. Once enough experience is attained from these ventures I will hopefully be accepted to a JD/MBA program which will in turn widen my options and allow me to fufill my dreams. If everything goes according to plan these goals will be accomplished before I turn 30.

I study politics, economics, and French, so my favorite sport is debating with my best friends at a dinner table. I like taking initiatives when I work, and if you care to ask me, I would call myself an event-driven, risk-averse investor. I'm very interested in "sharing economy"â€‹ and "collaborative consumption", and would love to talk with whoever shares the passion.

James Madison High School The University of Chicago There is no problem that admits no solution, only problems that admit no solutions inside the framework within which we have restricted our minds. When we are stymied by a problem, we are defeated by one of two things: either by our inability to adequately describe the world around us or by our inability to bend our mind through the requisite mental hoops. With this firm belief, I have turned my collegiate career towards overcoming these two limitations in myself.

??????? University of International Business and Economics Baruch College, City University of New York (CUNY) Like many other young professionals in their early career development, I have been ambitious to explore more opportunities and seek greater challenges. Additionally, as my experience accumulated, alongside the upgrade of interpersonal skills, analytical skills and specific techniques for dealing with foreign business partners, I started to ponder over in what industry and position I can upgrade my professional manner and competitiveness in a fastest pace. Fortunately as I was, COFOO Limited, Chinaâ€™s food industry giant who has been on the Fortune 500 list consecutively for the last 21 years, offered me the perfect opportunity to learn and grow. By far I have served in COFOO for more than 3 years. Starting with the position as Sales Supervisor in Coffee Department, I not only achieved excellent sales records of coffee products in my assigned regions, but also had chances to look into the agricultural economics and financial issues that I have intense interests in. For instance, when I took charge in the distribution of coffee products in domestic market, I associated with our business partners closely and understood how they employed sophisticated techniques to maximize the profitability that generated from their product reselling and investment. I also noticed how they would conduct dynamic revision of orders in accordance with important indexes of global agricultural futures market. My job pushed me to learn more and sparked my intense inquisitiveness about how essential products in our daily life play their significant role in the international capital markets. I was motivated to seek answers in my later career and scholastic pursuit.

We buy all over the US and will either scrap it, export it or resell it. We are the direct buyer, not a consignor or dealer or an auction. Our corporate clients use us because we will purchase their entire surplus fleet, regardless of location and quantity. They receive their money immediately instead of having to wait for an auction to take place or wait for the consignor to find a buyer. Surplus Solutions IS the buyer. With auctions, the selling price is unknown. We will make an offer on the entire package and if we are the highest (which we usually are!) we wire the money that day and pick up the equipment that week. It's a beautiful thing!

She is passionate about inventing technologies that transform human life and turning those technologies into products that have a lasting positive impact to the world. In the past, she developed nano-optical devices on elastomer substrates that could lead to highly sensitive molecular sensors; co-invented a transparent glass screen that could turn windows into displays; and created a startup/non-profit that helps better connect isolated communities. Right now besides spending her spare time employing technology to remove the emotional isolation created by technology, her working hours are devoted to developing a different type of immunotherapy with the assistance of microfluidics, which she hopes will make a significant contribution to the world-wide efforts in curing cancer and other diseases.

Tsinghua University IBG-3, Juelich Research Center, Germany Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences Long helped establishing a multi-scale soil moisture/temperature monitoring network in the central Tibetan Plateau, and fully participated the network design, field construction, sensor calibration, and data processing. The data is now open for the whole research community. Based on the in-situ observations, he proposed a new approach to capture areal mean soil moisture by using a few sites, which provided inspiration for network maintenance and soil moisture upscaling. His another work explored the optimal utilization of AMSR-E satellite data in land data assimilation for improving soil moisture estimate. He also found the accuracy of SMOS soil moisture product is scale-dependent and further designed a SMOS soil moisture land data assimilation scheme. In addition, he joined the construction of the turbulence stations on a Tibetan glacier (the first one in China) and on the Plateau westernmost Gobi desert. His current interest is on the global soil moisture estimate through multi-sensor data assimilation.

National Chengchi University National Cheng Kung University Technische Universit?t Darmstadt Currently an Engineer Manager at MSFT Big Data team -- SCOPE/Cosmos, leading the Query Optimizer team. SCOPE is a cloud-scale distributed computation platform built on top of Cosmos, a distributed file system design for high availability and scalability. The SCOPE/Cosmos platform runs as a service over tens of thousands of commodity servers, powering Bing and other Microsoft product teams. The SCOPE system combines benefits from both parallel databases and MapReduce execution engine. The SCOPE language is a declarative scripting language, resembling SQL, with integrated .NET extensions. It provides a single machine programming abstraction so that all our Bing developers can focus on their application logic rather than dealing with low-level details of distributed computation. At the same time, it allows us to perform transparent and systematic query optimization. My main charter is to design and implement the query optimizer for SCOPE that will transform the SQL-like scripts into efficient data flow execution plans that run on a MapReduce execution environment.

SMK Ave Maria Convent, Malaysia Taylor's University, Malaysia Indiana University Bloomington In one of the articles I read, communication skill is ranked as the top skill required in todayâ€™s job market. As an international student pursuing an American degree in the United States, language barrier does not stop me from enhancing my communication skills. The opportunities in Indiana University and Bloomington allow me to interact with people with different backgrounds. Not only do I get to interact with professors and peers through campus related activities, I also join several off campus activities. These activities encourage me to interact with people from the community including little kid and the elderly. Small talk, discussion and deep conversation with different people help me to gain different insights and enable me to learn things from different perspectives. I believe no matter what we are pursuing, communication skill is a key success factor.

University of California, Berkeley University of Southern California Jennifer Reynolds-Kaye is the Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman-Joan Whitney Payson Fellow in the Education Department at the Yale University Art Gallery. She began that position shortly after completing her PhD in Art History at the University of Southern California in May 2014. Her dissertation, â€œContemporary Pre-Columbian Art: Recasting Artifacts through Object Biographies,â€? focused on three contemporary Mexican artists who reinterpret pre-Columbian images in their work. In her postdoctoral appointment, she is continuing a vein of her research by examining the influence of pre-Columbian art on the work of Josef and Anni Albers. More specifically, she is curating an exhibition that looks at the Alberses as collectors of pre-Columbian objects and ancient Peruvian textiles. In her current position, she is also responsible for overseeing academic affairs for the Gallery, in which she works primarily with Yale faculty on integrating original works of art into their courses.

I aspired to pursue a career in healthcare as an undergraduate, but my career interests changed. Instead of healthcare, I became interested in data and everything associated with its usage. I will be obtaining a Masters degree in IT & Management Information Systems starting in January at UT Dallas. I dedicate my time reading and taking courses to learn the business and technical skills needed to pursue my aspirations of working with data. I love music, sports, science, and technology. I also hope to become an entrepreneur and start my own business one day.

National Taiwan University National Taiwan University Purdue University Climate is a significant factor for every aspect of the agricultural system, and the potential effects of climate change on agricultural production have drawn much attention. Crop yield, in particular, is vulnerable to climate and potential future climate change. My interests and expertise focus on agricultural production and environmental sustainability . My top priority and ultimate goal is to help farmers to improve crop productivity and prevent yield from climate damage. Through my Ph.D career and work experience, I developed research interests and professional skills including computational hydrology and agronomy modeling, working with large datasets, and computer programming. I learned strong crop model implementation, climate data handling, analytical skills, and computer software operation. I utilize crop models to evaluate effect of climate change on agricultural productivity and identify the pitfalls in the current production system. I also utilize the data obtained from multiple climate database to optimize management practices that would result in yield improvement, reduction in irrigation rate and increase in overall profit.

I have been successfully working with customers and technology experts on system requirement analysis, development, implementation, and delivery to drive better business value with online collaborative techniques. Outside of work, I volunteer for the Chinese Organization for Rare Disorders, a non-profit organization dedicated to building an information platform and network that analyzes the social impacts of rare diseases. Through helping research rare diseases and set up photo exhibitions nationwide, I have met many people with rare diseases and learned of their tough journeys seeking treatment. A lot of them need to see a lot of doctors before receiving a correct diagnosis, while almost half remain diagnosed incorrectly. These eye-opening experiences allowed me to gradually develop a deeper passion for merging information systems with healthcare.I am now pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Health Informatics in order to further develop my career and to expand on my passion for healthcare.

My life goal is being a person with compassion, with this life goal, I am able to consider the problem from the other one's view, able to communicate with others in an effective way. My career goal is being a sales, in my opinion, sales is not a man trying to sales a good to someone who do not want it, on the contrary, sales is the person who is able to recognize customer's problem, and send the good which can solve this problem to his customers. As I mentioned before, I am good at considering the problem from other's view, so I think being a good sales person will be suitable for me.

Through my father's work, I have learned to look at things from different angles and to think dimensionally when designing. I believe a good design has to have an unique language and a strong concept that attracts people's attention and tells a story. I always like to challenge myself to think differently and think metaphorically; my passion for design never sleeps.

Columbia University in the City of New York Columbia University in the City of New York A geochemist by profession and a water and sanitation specialist by vocation, I am interested in biogeochemistry of chemical compounds and elements in the environment and their effects on human and ecosystem health. The motivation for understanding the science is to guide the mitigation of problems to improve health in both developing and developed countries. Thus, the engineering and policy aspects of environmental problem solving are also of interest. Recently, my research has focused on geochemistry of arsenic in alluvial and deltaic aquifers of Bangladesh and bedrock aquifers of Maine. I have spent most of my career in research and teaching since 1988 and was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of America in 2010. I also worked in Bangladesh implementing water, sanitation and hygiene programs for UNICEF in 2010 and 2011 when I applied knowledge gained from a decade of directing research programs studying arsenic in groundwater of Bangladesh. I have also advised UNICEF China and China Geological Survey on their arsenic mitigation programs.

Peking University Peking Union Medical College University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Here please allow me to present myself as an outstanding structural biologist and pharmacologist, especially in the GPCR field. I received solid training on structural biology, particularly on X-ray crystallography, during my Ph.D study in University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. During my postdoctoral research in Kobilka lab in Stanford from 2008-2013, I had the precious opportunity to receive the first class training on the GPCR field and devoted myself to investigating this super important drug target structurally and pharmacologically. This experience not only helped me obtain abundant knowledge and deep understanding on GPCRs, but also made me armed with novel methodologies and advanced concepts to face challenging projects in my future career. After I joined Pfizer in 2013, my expertise has helped me obtain great success on multiple projects to impact downstream drug design. More importantly, it has been well appreciated in my department that my experience and creativity has reshaped the internal platform for the structural studies of GPCRs and helped to bring the research to a higher level. Currently I am also leading a team to build a yeast display platform to obtain/evolve nanobodies from synthetic libraries to facilitate the structural characterization of GPCRS, or to a more general extent, any other protein that needs a stabilizing chaperon.

Columbia University in the City of New York University of Notre Dame Columbia University - Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation J.J. Pearce High School As a fresh graduate from school, I look forward to the growth and learning opportunities in the professional world as I try to build my own career. After many years in school, one thing stands out for me: the best architecture engages the people. I hope the work I do in this field is as much about the buildings as it is about the people and the community. I really admire bankers, politicians, parents, and comedians. Not necessarily in that order, however.

If there is a silver bullet to ease the complexity of software development, I would say it has to be the "passion". Only with passion, you are accumulating technical knowledge and applying them in day-to-day tedious while challenging operations. I found my background in computer networking, programming and my capability to troubleshoot issues easily were very helpful during this course. My interest is to design and develop intelligent and automated large scale software systems.

National Taiwan University Harvard University Yu-li Wang's broad academic training and work experience, encompassing colleges of basic science, medicine, and engineering as well as hospitals and research institutes, have allowed him to communicate with an unusually wide range of professionals for fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. His research has focused on aspects of cellular mechanical activities that serve as the foundation for cell and tissue engineering. His major contributions include the development of live cell imaging using fluorescently tagged proteins (1970â€™s; Landmark Paper in Cell Biology), the elucidation of frontal extension mechanism for cell migration (1980â€™s), the development of elastic polyacrylamide substrates for cellular mechanical studies including traction force microscopy (1990â€™s), the demonstration of equatorial signals for triggering cell division (1990's), and the discovery of cellular sensitivities to materials rigidity (1990â€™s) and preferential cellular migration toward rigid materials (2000â€™s). His studies have been described in textbooks and have provided some of the very fundamental principles for the fields of cell mechanics and tissue engineering. Yu-li Wang has published over 120 papers and edited three books. Three of his papers have received over 1000 citations and three other papers received over 500 citations. In addition, one of his papers was collected in the book â€œLandmark Papers in Cell Biologyâ€?. He has also co-organized international conferences on cell division and on live cell imaging.

Miami University Miami University Andrew Sokol, B.Sc.-A.C.S. an Accredited American Chemical Society (ACS) Chemist, engages in "DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES". Disruptive technologies, associated knowledge and "know-how" are protected by corporations and governments through extensive security measures. Technology deemed valuable and/or critical to the security or competitive position of an organization is developed "in-house" by personnel in the employ & control of the organization. Should that organization lose control of such technology it would result in highly disruptive damage to the security or competitive position of the organization.

Northwest Normal University Northwest Normal University Kansas State University I have been working in ultrafast laser interaction with atoms and molecules since 2008. My research is mainly to develop the macroscopic propagation model for high-order harmonic generation of atoms and molecules. I have studied the photoelectron angular distribution of molecules by XUV using the established photoionization theory, and proposed a method of ionization gating to produce the isolated attosecond pulses by the macroscopic propagation. I was also involved in developing the tunneling model to study the molecular ionization and developing an imaging producedure to get the internuclear separation of molecules. My recent research interests are to optimize a waveform by synthezing multi-color laser fields to greatly enhance the efficiencies of harmonics in the XUV and soft X-rays and the harmonic generation in a hollow waveguide.

Beijing No. 80 High School Indiana University Bloomington I am Cheng Shi, and I am currently studying at Indiana University Bloomington. I major in mathematics and minor in both computer science and Italian. I am passionated about mathematics. When I was a little child, one of my favorite games was Sudoko. I could spend a whole day doing Sudoko. From my perspective, mathematics is a different language which practices people's logical thinking and analytical skills. Mathematics is a good tool to analyze the phenomena of world. I am also fascinated by computer science. Although computer science is a fresh subject, the rate of its development is very fast. One of my professors at IU told me that the programming language we are using today may be eliminated in a few years later. The combination of a Major in Mathematics and Minors in Computer Science brings be both opportunities and challenges. The modern world is a digital world so people use mathematics and computer science to solve current problems. However, the digital world is more competitive which means that I have to study harder and work harder to keep on track with the modern world. I also have chosen Italian to be my minor because I find it is interesting. I can speak, listen, read and write Italian proficiently.

The University of Texas at Austin University of Houston I am a molecular microbiologist and cell biologist with an interest in studying the underlying basis of microbial pathogenesis in human disease. I also spend a significant portion of my time conducting pedagogical duties. This includes the lecturing of medical and dental students, but has also included participation in a program that focuses on improving science curricula for high school students. My research focuses on the host response to microbial virulence factors, specifically those of Escherichia coli (i.e. Shiga toxins and subtilase-like toxin) that are a cause of severe life-threatening microangiopathic disease. Recent advances in this work include the identification of a novel role for the kinase ZAK in inflammatory signaling, as well as the use and development of 3-dimensional renal tissue models for studying Shiga toxin-mediated illness. Other projects include the study of the anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic organisms, phage isolation and characterization, and understanding the role of intestinal dysfunction and gut microbiota in end-stage heart failure. My future goals include working and collaborating within a multi-disciplinary team to take on novel and challenging projects in science, business, or pedagogy.

Tianjin University Columbia University in the City of New York Columbia University in the City of New York Tianjin University My research interest focuses on controlling self-assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) in a polymer matrix (either amorphous or semi-crystalline) and from there the macroscopic properties of the resulting polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). For static NPs structural characterization, electron microscopy and scattering techniques (light, X-rays and neutrons) are combined. The dynamic behavior of this composite system has also been studied using DSC, dielectric/mechanical spectroscopy. Rheology, Brillouin light scattering, DMTA and 3-point bending were used for a through evaluation of the mechanical performance of the resulting PNCs. Currently, primary efforts are focused on understanding the interplay between matrix crystallization and NP self-assembly as well as its practically important consequences in a semi-crystalline PNC.

Everyday, I am learning more about myself, my limitations, my strengths, my passions, and what I can do to contribute to my community. The following quote describes my passion for learning: "To be a good geek you have to have both humility and arrogance in equal measures. The humility is so you'll admit you don't know something and get help/read the docs/etc. The arrogance is the bit that says, "I don't know that now.. but I can and I will soon." - Thomas Beagle

I completed my PhD study at Prof. David Crichâ€™s lab at the University of Illinois at Chicago and later at Wayne State University in the field of carbohydrate chemistry. I had worked on two major directions including selective protection and glycosylation of saccharides. I also dig into the first glycopeptide synthesis project at the Crich lab. Before I joined the Crich lab, I had already enriched my experience of total synthesis at Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, where I completed the synthesis of squalamine. Most of my jobs could be tracked in details in 15 publications including JACS, OL, JOC etc.

My research focuses on the use of animals in ancient societies; especially the ways that people in early civilizations controlled animal products and used animals in religious rituals. I am particularly interested in the how sheep and cattle were introduced to China during the late 3rd Millennium BCE. Sheep and cattle herding provided opportunities for people to diversify their animal management systems during periods of environmental and social change. Herding also allowed people to specialize in new crafts such as wool textile production and bone artifact production that were incorporated into the complex economic exchange systems of large political centers.

She is passionate about inventing technologies that transform human life and turning those technologies into products that have a lasting positive impact to the world. In the past, she developed nano-optical devices on elastomer substrates that could lead to highly sensitive molecular sensors; co-invented a transparent glass screen that could turn windows into displays; and created a startup/non-profit that helps better connect isolated communities. Right now besides spending her spare time employing technology to remove the emotional isolation created by technology, her working hours are devoted to developing a different type of immunotherapy with the assistance of microfluidics, which she hopes will make a significant contribution to the world-wide efforts in curing cancer and other diseases.

We provide educational programs and monthly Chinese cultural events to adopted Chinese children and college students in Nashville. I made a few changes after I became president. I applied knowledge from my Organizational Development class in order to turn around low participation and to increase funds from Vanderbilt. First of all, I built a new vision for the organization. We used to serve only adopted children, but now we are targeting at a broader population which includes college students. Second, based on the new vision, we reached out to Asian Study Department at Vanderbilt and Chinese Culture Club at Belmont University, and we successfully built partnerships with them. These change helped us doubled our particularization. As a result, Vanderbilt raised our funds by 60%.

In one project, I found that the hippocampus plays a permanent role in the retrieval of detailed memories and a transient role in the retrieval of memories that degrade over time. In a different project, I found that a component of the affective and cognitive phenotypes in neurodevelopmental disorders (such as schizophrenia) may be caused by disruptions in adult-born neurons, and adult treatments directed at this cell population may have a significant impact on these phenotypes. Now I am studying a receptor that may serve as a memory suppressor, and a mutation of this receptor in animal models results in enhanced cognitive function.

ELS language center university of cincinnati My name is Ning Dai. I am a Chinese student in University of Cincinnati. My major is accounting. I was living in a conservative family because we are traditional family. However, I am a optimistic and passionate person. I love traveling and my dream is to travel around the world. My parents are not outgoing people but I enjoy the happiness when we are living together. I finished my elementary school, middle school and high school in my hometown Tang Shan. Also, I love this city where I was living for 18 years. I participate in the Chinese college entrance examination which is like the SAT in America. The reason why I did not choose Chinese universities is because I love American education. After I attend classes in the university, I think the American education fits me very well. I chose a right way to enhance my abilities, such as creativity and imagination. I believed that I can graduate from UC with a good score. Also, I planed to get my master degree in the United States too. I will go back to China because there are a lot of employment opportunities in China. Also, I need to take care of my parents. I am missing them right now.

Li Po Chun United World College of Hong Kong Dartmouth College "Finding the cure for cancer"â€‹ is often shipped as the ultimate fantasy goal to have, second only to (ethical and peaceful, of course) world domination. I have happened to make this my life's cause instead of letting it remain an unattainable dream. I think the waters to be explored in the area of cancer therapy are vast and wondrous, and in the future I would like to combine nanotechnology in genetic engineering through research and development for effective cancer treatment. As a self-supporting student in college, I have had the opportunity to not only learn the nuances of balancing work with academic and personal life, but also to pick up on a wide range of skills. I love incorporating creativity and innovation to research and scientific problems, and I spend a lot of my time designing projects and brainstorming ideas in my own head to create positive outcome.

Unfortunately, the traditional paradigm of reductionist, basic experimentation has failed to yield the expected progress in curing diseases. The reasons for this are multiple and complex, but I believe the solution lies in designing approaches which acknowledge the incredible complexity of the human body, borrowing techniques from computer science and the physical sciences, and fostering a truly multidisciplinary, collaborative effort to bring every possible tool to bear on this challenge.

Guizhou University Shanghai Institutes for Biological Science I conducted my Ph.D studies in Shanghai Institutes for Biology, Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) from Sep. 2005 to Jul. 2012 and got my Ph.D there. During my Ph.D studies, I focused my research on mechanism of crosstalk between the steroid hormone signaling and nutrition signaling in insects using silkworm Bombyx mori and fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster as animal model in the research, and I published one paper (first author) on the journal "Insect Molecular Biology" (SCI indexed) and one review paper (first author) on "Applied Entomology" as well as 4 papers (as co-author) on other SCI-indexed journal. I learned skills and methods of molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, insect physiology and insect genetics during my Ph.D studies. I am familiar with the progress of my research field and am able to propose new scientific ideas and to conduct project research independently.

University of Missouri-Columbia University of Missouri University of Missouri The Akers Lab aims to develop novel preclinical and translational molecular imaging approaches to diagnose, stage and monitor disease. We are committed to innovative and collaborative biomedical research through optical and multimodal imaging technologies, to change the way medicine is seen. In light of this goal, we strive to illuminate biochemical and cellular events in vivo using fluorescent reporters and non-invasive or minimally invasive detection technologies. Combination of optical techniques with other methods like magnetic resonance or nuclear imaging are also investigated as complementary methods for interrogating pathological conditions, enhancing information content beyond the scope of individual modalities. The overarching aim of this research is translation of optical imaging methods to clinical applications in human medicine. Translational projects include multimodal sentinel lymph node mapping for breast cancer staging and fluorescence guided surgery.

My lab is interested in studying intercellular interactions during tissue homeostasis and determining how de-regulated interactions among cells promote cell transformation and tumor progression. The goal of our research is to find molecular targets and biomarkers for cancer therapy. We integrate molecular, cellular, and biochemical approaches in combination with mouse tumorigenesis models. Currently, one of our major focuses is elucidating the regulation and function of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway in cancer. In addition, we are using in vitro and in vivo models to dissect biological interactions between heterogeneous malignant cells and to study functional consequences of intra-tumor heterogeneity.

Seminole High School Emory University Wei Wei is an undergraduate student pursuing Film and Media Management and the Integrated Visual Arts Co-Major at Emory University. She is fascinated by the power that words and images have to bring people closer to understanding the human condition. Since Animation combines the two, she aims to study it from an interdisciplinary perspective that goes beyond production to include scholarly analysis of how and why mere illustrations of reality resonate with people and impact them to enact change.

Sichuan University Peking Union Medical College Peking Union Medical College Over last decade, Dr. Zhou has developed strong interest to dissect the functions of candidate genes identified from genetics studies in complex disease. With the rapid progress in high-throughput sequencing, there is increasing number of genetics regions associated with complex traits identified from human population. However, on the other side, relatively specified low-throughput functional assays limit our progress to transform genetics information to understand the disease pathobiology. The Functional Respiratory Genetics Laboratory led by Dr. Zhou are interested to address those fundamental questions that how genetic variants affects disease susceptibilities, mainly asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease(COPD). There are several research directions in Dr Zhou's laboratory 1) Through histone modification and chromatin structure analysis to localize functional variants from the GWAS regions and follow up with validation in vitro and in vivo; 2) understand and distangle the gene-by-environmental interactions from molecular level by Chromatin Immunoprcipitation(ChIP) followed by next-generation sequencing; 3) develop new approaches to localize the regulatory elements in the GWAS regions to facilitate us to understand the mechanism of how causal variants function; 4)dissect the role of the COPD and asthma susceptible genes in vitro by combining gene transcriptome profiling induced by â€œloss-of-functionâ€? and protein-protein interaction network; 5) fully investigate the role of COPD candidate genes in smoke induced emphysema model.

In law school, I continued to develop my background in international affairs through the International Human Rights clinic at Fordham while broadening my horizons in other areas of public law. In particular, I am very experienced and knowledgeable in immigration law, having done immigration work both summers during law school. I would love to explore business immigration work to tie into my previous background in international business. I am currently a third year student at Fordham Law, and concurrently an intern at Bergen County Family Courts and a research assistant for criminal law professor Bruce Green at Fordham Law.

Chengdu Number 7 High School Agnes Scott College University of Pennsylvania I'm working on characterizing exosortase, an enzyme involved in a novel surface protein anchoring mechanism primarily in gram negative bacteria. In silico work in gram negative bacteria and empirical data in gram positive bacteria and archaea suggest that the exosortases and their substrates might be critical in biofilm formation and/or maintenance. It is predicted that the substrates get to the outer membrane following processing by exosortase on the cell membrane, similar to that of their counterparts in gram positive bacteria (sortase substrates) and archaea (archaeosortase substrates). Model organisms used are Geobacter sulfurreducens and Nitrosomonas europaea, both with bioremediation prospects.

C i y n   i i c t r s e v e l o l e g e   o f   n o i Y   M i e d s e n U My researches for the past several years were primarily focused on diabetes and on functional Î²-cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo.Recently my study was focused on rodent pancreatic beta-cell proliferation. FTY720, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, was tested in db/db mice and found FTY720 normalizes blood glucose level by stimulating Î²-cell proliferation. More recently, I have screened more than 2000 compounds and found out that many compounds can stimulate Î²-cell replication in vitro. Briefly, rodent islets were isolated and digested into single cells, and then the cells were plated onto 96 or 384-well plates and treated with various compounds. The proliferation was determined by insulin and Ki67 (or PCNA) double staining. As a result, I found that more than 200 compounds can stimulate pancreatic beta-cell replication by 2 to 9 folds. Some of these compounds were also tested on human islet cells and showed the same effects as they did in rodent islet cells.
